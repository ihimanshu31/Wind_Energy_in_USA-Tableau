Project 8 >> Capstone Project >> Udacity: Data visualization Nanodegree 

By now, you've completed several guided projects, and now's your chance to show off your skills and creativity. You'll receive a review of your project with feedback from a Udacity mentor, and they will focus on how your project demonstrates the skills you've learned. This project is designed to prepare you for delivering a polished, end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem in a field of interest.
